# Task: [Your Task Title Here]

## Objective

[Describe what you want Claude to accomplish. Be specific and clear.]

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion 3]

## Context

[Provide relevant background information, constraints, or existing code context.]

## Instructions

1. Read the current progress from `progress.md` if it exists
2. Continue from where the previous iteration left off
3. After making progress, update `progress.md` with:
   - What you accomplished
   - What remains to be done
   - Any blockers or issues encountered
4. When ALL success criteria are met, set `## Status: DONE` in progress.md
5. If you're blocked and need human help, set `## Status: BLOCKED` in progress.md

## Notes

- Each iteration runs with fresh context, so always check progress.md first
- Be thorough but efficient - make meaningful progress each iteration
- If tests exist, run them to verify your changes
